# Distribution Manager

Desktop application realized as volunteering work for Music for Peace, a humanitarian organization based in Genoa. The goal of the project is to realize an app to manage the distribution of primary need goods during the humanitarian missions. 

The application has been developed using Electron.js and React, starting from a boilerplate template. The application interacts with a MySQL DB that is hosted on the Amazon RDS service.
